# Home Styler

Make your about:home page stylish! Fork of [About Home Themer](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/about-home-themer/) by Alfred Kayser for Pale Moon.

This styles the about:home page for complete themes that support such customisation. As such, it will not have any affect on the default theme, or themes which do not support about:home theming.

## Building
Simply download the contents of the "src" folder  and pack the contents into a .zip file. Then, rename the file to .xpi and drag into the browser.
